	<ul>
		<li>I think you can be more coniderate where you break lines. Maybe decrease font size for mobile versions?</li>
		<li>I would recommend to keep the same amount of text for pc and mobile version.</li>
		<li>It's supposed to be a 'quote' so maybe just put the lyrics to one sentence by using lower case and periods.</li>
		<li>First image is pixelated for mobile version and also not the same image with the one for pc. Is it intentional and if it is when are you going to swap the image?</li>
		<li>You might want to use differnet color for the box and the text on either first verison or second version.</li>
		<li>You can play with opacity of the box - I think it could be better if the image in the back shows through?</li>

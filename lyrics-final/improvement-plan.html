	<h1>Improvement Plan</h1>

	<p>I talked to Amy and Mimi about my design and followings were the suggestions.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Incorporate the pattern and color that is shown in the illustration to the whole design.</li>
		<li>Increase the line height so that it is easier for the viewers to read the lyrics.</li>
		<li>Be consistant with the margin between verses.</li>
	</ul>

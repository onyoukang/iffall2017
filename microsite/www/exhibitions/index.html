	<h3>EXHIBITIONS</h3>

		<h4>Tate Modern, London</h4>
		<p>Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs was exhibited at London’s Tate Modern, from April to September 2014. The show was the largest and most extensive of the cut-outs ever mounted, including approximately 100 paper maquettes—borrowed from international public and private collections—as well as a selection of related drawings, prints, illustrated books, stained glass, and textiles. In total, the retrospective featured 130 works encompassing his practice from 1937 to 1954. The Tate Modern show was the first in its history to attract more than half a million people.</p>

		<h4>Museum of Modern Art, New York</h4>
		<p>The show then traveled to New York’s Museum of Modern Art, where it was on display through 10 February 2015. The newly conserved cut-out, The Swimming Pool, which had been off view for more than 20 years prior, returned to the galleries as the centerpiece of the exhibition.</p>

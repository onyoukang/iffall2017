		<p id="last">Bathers with a Turtle is a painting by Henri Matisse from 1907â€“08, in the collection of the Saint Louis Art Museum in St. Louis, Missouri. It was purchased for $2400 by Joseph Pulitzer, Jr. in 1939 at an auction of art that the Nazi government considered "degenerate." He later donated it to the museum. Prior to that it had been in the collection of the Folkwang Museum in Essen, Germany. Pulitzer purchased it at the urging of Matisse's son Pierre Matisse, in order to prevent the artwork from being destroyed, despite the profit from the auction going to the Nazis.</p>

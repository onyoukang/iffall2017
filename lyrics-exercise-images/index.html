		<p class="intro">Now this is a story all about how<br>
		My life got flipped turned upside down<br>
		And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there<br>
		I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air</p>

		<p class="verse">In West Philadelphia, born and raised<br>
		On the playground is where I spent most of my days<br>
		Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool<br>
		And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school<br>
		When a couple of guys who were up to no good<br>
		Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood<br>
		I got in one little fight and my mom got scared<br>
		And said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"</p>

		<img src="images/will-2.gif">

		<p class="verse">I begged and pleaded with her day after day<br>
		But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way<br>
		She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket<br>
		I put my Walkman on and said "I might as well kick it"<br>
		First class, yo, this is bad<br>
		Drinkin' orange juice out of a champagne glass<br>
		Is this what the people of Bel-Air livin' like?<br>
		Hmmm, this might be all right<br>
		But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that<br>
		Is this the type of place that they just sent this cool cat?<br>
		I don't think so, I'll see when I get there<br>
		I hope they're prepared for the Prince of Bel-Air</p>

		<p class="verse">Well, uh, the plane landed and when I came out<br>
		There was a dude looked like a cop standin' there with my name out<br>
		I ain't tryin' to get arrested yet, I just got here<br>
		I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared<br>
		I whistled for a cab and when it came near<br>
		The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirror<br>
		If anything I could say that this cab was rare<br>
		But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo holmes, to Bel-Air!"</p>

		<img src="images/will-4.gif">

		<p class="outro">I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8<br>
		And I yelled to the cabbie "Yo holmes, smell ya later"<br>
		Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there<br>
		To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air</p>

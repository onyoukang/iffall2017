	<p id="first">Now this is a story all about how <br>
	My life got flipped-turned upside down <br>
	And I’d like to take a minute <br>
	Just sit right there <br>
	I’ll tell you how I became  <br>
	the prince of a town called Bel-Air</p>

	<p>In west Philadelphia born and raised <br>
	On the playground was where I spent most of my days <br>
	Chillin’ out maxin’ relaxin’ all cool <br>
	And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school <br>
	When a couple of guys who were up to no good <br>
	Started making trouble in my neighborhood <br>
	I got in one little fight and my mom got scared She said, “You’re <br>movin’ with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air.”</p>

	<p>I begged and pleaded with her day after day <br>
	But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way <br>
	She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket. <br>
	I put my Walkman on and said, “I might as well kick it.”</p>

	<p>First class, yo, this is bad <br>
	Drinkin’ orange juice out of a champagne glass <br>
	Is this what the people of Bel-Air livin’ like? <br>
	Hmmm, this might be all right <br>
	But wait, I hear they’re prissy, bourgeois, and all that <br>
	Is this the type of place that they just sent this cool cat? <br>
	I don’t think so, I’ll see when I get there <br>
	I hope they’re prepared for the Prince of Bel-Air</p>

	<p>Well, uh, the plane landed and when I came out <br>
	There was a dude looked like a cop <br>
	standin’ there with my name out <br>
	I ain’t tryin’ to get arrested yet, I just got here <br>
	I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared <br>
	I whistled for a cab and when it came near <br>
	The license plate said ‘Fresh’ and it had dice in the mirror <br>
	If anything I could say that this cab was rare <br>
	But I thought “Nah, forget it, yo holmes, to Bel-Air!”</p>

	<p>I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 <br>
	And I yelled to the cabbie “Yo holmes, smell ya later” <br>
	Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there <br>
	To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air</p>
